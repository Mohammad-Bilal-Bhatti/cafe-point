## Description
project desc...

## Motivation
This project is made by me when I was in third semester of my engineering studies. I made this project for fun :) because I always wanted to see how these projects build and work. So, for checking my skills I decided to work on that simple idea... 

## Technologies
- Java | base technology
- java swing | for building app windows
- java awt | for handing events and listeners
- java file r-w system | for file-based database systems.

## Execute and Run project
In order to run open the terminal and execute the following commands.

```cmd
javac *.java
java CafeShop
```


## UI
The user interface is crazy and ugly because when I was in the begining I was unaware of the design concept. So, at that time I haven't focused on design aspects of the application.
